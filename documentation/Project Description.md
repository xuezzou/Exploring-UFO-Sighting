#### Project description 

---
Using the [UFO Sighting data](https://www.kaggle.com/NUFORC/ufo-sightings) from [National UFO Reporting Center](http://www.nuforc.org/), which reports unidentified flying object over the last century, our team aims to investigate questions such as where or when most UFO sightseeing occurs, identify patterns or correlations across *geo* and *time* information, and, possibly, derives some mysterious theories related to extra-terrestrials. We would also consider the *shape* and appeared *duration* of the alien reported. An interesting data attribute would be the detailed *comment* of each report, which would help us gain better insights into the data.

(interaction zoom out each state with shape as individuals)
(county data json, longtitude, attitude, aggregation)
(sequential color)
(5 sheet strategy)
